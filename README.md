# Android-Helper-Classes
This repository contains links to some Helper classes for Android that I have written or modified over Android source classes

## List of helper classes

- [CountUpTimer](https://gist.github.com/shrey-g-a-r-g/428b4f001e2dd5457fed0339b6b0ea82) : This class can be used as a CountUpTimer in Android. This class is modified upon the source code of android.os.CountDownTimer offered by Android.

- [Latch](https://gist.github.com/shrey-g-a-r-g/411fda86f2cc1166bdfaa529bcf8f527) : A synchronization helper class that allows one thread to wait until a set of operations being performed completes. Modified upon java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch - Added acquire() method in Latch.Sync, removed count input, set count initially to 0.
